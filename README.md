# adv-statistics-random-sound-player

This project is for my Advanced Statistics class.

This project is a random sound player that is used to change subject stimuli. It plays a random sound at random intervals in an attempt to throw the subject off-guard. I am testing to see correlation between frequency of random sounds played and reaction time of subject.
