# adv-statistics-random-sound-player

This is a random sound player that is used to change subject stimuli for my project in my Advanced Statistics class. It plays a sound randomly over time in an attempt to throw the subject off-guard. I am testing to see correlation between frequency of random sounds played and reaction time of subject.
